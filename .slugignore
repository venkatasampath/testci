# Ignoring files with .slugignore
# If your repository contains files not necessary to run your app,
# you may wish to add these to a .slugignore file in the root of your repository.
#
# Examples of files you may wish to exclude from the slug:
# 1. Art sources (like .psd files)
# 2. Design documents (like .pdf files)
#
# The .slugignore file causes files to be removed after you push code to Heroku and before the buildpack runs.
# This lets you prevent large files from being included in the final slug
#
# Your slug size is displayed at the end of a successful compile after the Compressing message.
# The maximum allowed slug size (after compression) is 500 MB.
