### Org Reports

The Org Reports dashboard is accessible by organization admin only. You can expand/collapse all report tabs or individual tabs and also drag and rearrange the tab arrangement. This arrangement is saved even after the user logs out. This state is saved in your local storage until browser cache is cleared. Each report pane holds an image of its respective sample report showing column names of that report.
